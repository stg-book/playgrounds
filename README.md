# Swift Translation Guide for Objective-C Developers

This repository contains companion material for the book "Swift Translation Guide for Objective-C Developers" by Maurice Kelly. The material comes in the format of Swift Playgrounds for use with Xcode, but in many cases will be suitable for use in standard Xcode projects, or in the Swift REPL.

## Using the Code

The best way to use this material is to clone it to your local hard drive. For example, to place a copy in your `Documents` directory execute the following commands at the terminal:

```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/stg-book
cd ~/Documents/stg-book
git clone https://github.com/stg-book/playgrounds
```

The cloned repository will appear in a directory called `playgrounds` and will contain a collection of Swift playgrounds that can be opened in Xcode 6.1 or higher.

## Problems?

If you notice any problems with the code please feel free to raise an issue on this repository, or to fork the repo, fix the problem and submit a pull request.
